# Lambda School Example Files.

## An opinionated overview of how all code examples and resources should be stored for students and instructors in the Lambda School Program.


### File nomenclature

1. All files must include all caps abbreviation for the class which they were taught.
- ex: "CS1" "LS2" "PT4"

2. Abbreviations are to be followed (in the 'snake_case' format) with the date for which the information was taught. The date is to be written in the standard month (01) day (01) year (17).
- ex: "LS1_05-05-17"

3. All files must contain a topic for the material being taught following the date in the 'snake_case' format.
- ex: "LS1_05-05-17_closures.js"

### File organization

Each file should be stored in the directory that corrisponds with the topic being presented. If there is no directory for a topic, feel free to create one and push that change to this repository.


### Extra resources

If you feel there is a need to include extra resources as links in the file feel free to do so in the top of the document. You may want to do this as these files come from live coding examples and you it'd be nice to link to the YouTube video that was saved from the lecture.
